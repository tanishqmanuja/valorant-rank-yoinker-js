VRYJS is a CLI tool for displaying your valorant match data - rank, peak rank, skins etc in real time. It is a minimal port (rewrite) of the OG project [VALORANT Rank Yoinker](https://github.com/zayKenyon/VALORANT-rank-yoinker) which is written in python.

What makes this tool unique ?
  - Automatic Reconnection
  - Parallel Fetching
  - Data Caching
  - Logging
  - Informative UI
  - Configurable Plugins

## üì¶ Installation

1. Download `vryjs.exe` from the latest [release](https://github.com/tanishqmanuja/valorant-rank-yoinker-js/releases/).
2. Place the downloaded file in a separate folder because it generates temporary helper folder and files for caching, logging, executing etc.
3. Run and Enjoy!
